# Linear-Classification

Explanation of files
  - distribution.py creates synthetic data set with given number N, which represents the number of data points.
    Implementation is same with the file 'distribution_module.py' in Neuralnetwork classification directory.
  - decision_boundary.py draw line of f(x, y) = 0 in two dimensional space.
    Implementation is same with the file 'decision_boundary.py' in NueralNetwork classification directory.
  - linear_classification.py contains method to evaluate the maximum likelihood solution of weight vector in linear classification
    problem. You can choose two types of function _phi, _phi2 as basis function.
  - main.py imports above files and draw decision boundary of linear classification model and optimal boundary.
